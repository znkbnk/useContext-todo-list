In this project, you will build a
simple Todo List application using
React and the useContext hook. The
useContext hook in React is used to
access and share state and functions
across components without the need
for prop drilling. It allows components
to consume values from a context and
subscribe to updates to that context,
simplifying the management of shared
state in a React application.

Step 1: Setup

-  Create a new React project using
Create React App or your preferred method.
-  Set up the basic project structure
with a component folder, and create
a new file called TodoApp.js
in the components folder.

Step 2: Create Context

-  In the components folder, create a
new file called TodoContext.js.
-  Import React and create a new context
using the createContext function.
-  Export the created context.

Step 3: Create Todo Provider

-  In the components folder, create a
new file called TodoProvider.js.
-  Import React, the created context,
and any other dependencies you may need.
-  Create a functional component
called TodoProvider.
-  Inside the TodoProvider component,
define the state and state-modifying
functions using the useState hook.
-  Wrap the content of the TodoProvider
component with the created context
provider using the Context.Provider
component. Pass the state and
state-modifying functions as values
to the provider.
-  Export the TodoProvider component.

Step 4: Create Todo List Component

-  In the components folder, create
a new file called TodoList.js.
Import React and the created context.
-  Create a functional component
called TodoList.
-  Inside the TodoList component,
use the useContext hook to access
the shared state and state-modifying
functions from the context.
-  Render a list of todos using
the shared state.
-  Add an input field and a button
to allow the user to add new
todos. Implement the logic to
add new todos using the
state-modifying functions.
-  Export the TodoList component.

Step 5: Update TodoApp Component

-  Open the TodoApp.js file in the
components folder.
-  Import React, the created context,
and the TodoList component.
-  Inside the TodoApp component,
wrap the TodoList component
with the TodoProvider component.
-  Render the TodoList component.
-  Export the TodoApp component.

Step 6: Style the Todo List App
(optional)

-  Add CSS styles to make your
Todo List app visually appealing.
You can use your preferred method,
such as inline styles, CSS modules,
or a CSS preprocessor like SCSS.

Step 7: Test the Application

-  Start the development server and
test your Todo List app in the browser.
-  Add some todos, mark them as completed,
and verify that the state is shared
correctly between components.
